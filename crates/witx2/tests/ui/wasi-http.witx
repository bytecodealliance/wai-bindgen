// Note: this note isn't a doc comment.

// Note: the following comment block is a doc comment, because it start with `///`.
// It's also a comment about the interface defined in this file, because it starts with `@interface`

/// @interface WASI HTTP Core functionality.
///
/// Defines Requests & Responses and associated types, and `fetch`.

// `use` imports things from namespaces. The first identifier of an `ident1::ident2::[..]::identN`
// namespace chain needs to be resolved out of band. The remaining part of the chain is resolved
// as nested interfaces inside the definition of `ident1`.
// Note: I'm not sure if Result should just be an Interface Types thing instead of a WASI thing.
//use { Result, Option } from wasi::core

/// A blocking function for turning Requests into Responses.
/// @param req - a `Request` object to process
/// @return resp - the `Result` object produced once the blocking operation has finished.
//
// Note: the syntax for function definitions is chosen with three goals in mind:
//
// 1. maximizing human parseability and intuitive understanding, by not presupposing
// familiarity with any specific notations. Having the `function` keyword isn't otherwise
// strictly required for disambiguation. This becomes even more important given that part of
// the "weirdness budget" needs to be used for having support for multiple return values.
//
// 2. uniformity in the face of multiple return values. Basically, it's always a mapping
// of N arguments to M return values, with the same syntax for both.
//
// 3. provide an obvious place for adding attributes, like `blocking` and `reentrant`.
//
// Note: the `blocking` attribute means that different lowering can be generated for this
// function, either based on synchronous, blocking calls, or on a callback-style interface.
fetch: /*blocking*/ function(req: handle Request) -> handle Response

/// A Request resource, with lots of things missing for now.
// Note: `resource` blocks serve two purposes:
// 1. namespacing the definition of a Handle type with functions for operating on that handle
// 2. providing a way to define said functions such that they implicitly take the handle itself as
//    the first argument. E.g., `method` in `Request` is roughly equivalent to
//    `Request::method: function(self: handle Request) -> (string)`
//    ("Roughly" because the `resource` semantics allow us to generate better bindings for languages
//     that have a concept of implicit receivers, such as `this` in JS.)
resource Request {

    /// A static function acting as a constructor
    /// @return req - returns a new `Request`
    // Note: `static` here simply means that no implicit receiver argument will be passed.
    // I.e., this is ~roughly~ analogous to a top-level definition of
    // `Request::Request: function() -> (req: handle Request)`
    // whereas without `static`, it'd be analogous to
    // `Request::Request: function(self: handle<Request>) -> (req: handle<Request>)`

    method: function() -> string

    // Note: We could consider allowing the parens to be omitted for single return values, like so:
    headers: function() -> handle Headers

    // Note: Or we could even allow leaving off the return value identifier, making it use the
    // function name, like so:
    body: function() -> handle Body // This return type would be shorthand for `(body: Body)`
